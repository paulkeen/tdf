## Commitment

Commitment is considered as important word at Tyro.

**We commit to delivering the objective, NOT all the requirements.**

As we work on delivery, somethings get easier, often they get harder.
Commitment means the team have a shared goal with Product, with a
best-efforts approach on delivery.

Should delivering the objectives be in doubt (for example, the feature
will not meet with MVP) then as a collective, we work through options of
scope, resourcing, or time. For Projects, this should be brought to the
Steering Committee.
