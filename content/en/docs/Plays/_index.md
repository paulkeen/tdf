## Crazy 8

Crazy 8\'s are a sketching technique used for fast, broad idea
generation.

The focus is on ***quantity*, not quality**.

The idea is that you give people a piece of paper, with 8 equal spaces
on it, and ask them to sketch 8 different ideas in 8 minutes (hence,
Crazy 8).

There\'s no magic to the number 8, this works just as well with 6 but
anything less than 4 can narrow people\'s thinking. If they stretch
themselves beyond the obvious ideas, that\'s where some of the truly
innovative and different ideas can come from.

**During a Session (possible flow)**

1.  Present the problem/opportunity we\'re ideating on

2.  If a large group, break people into smaller groups

3.  People do Crazy 8\'s individually (8 minutes)

4.  Shareback their ideas to their group 

5.  Give them another round to refine their ideas, possibly taking bits
    and pieces from other members of the groups ideas (5-10 mins)

6.  Shareback top ideas to everyone

7.  Vote on the top ideas

**DACI quick reference: **

D = Driver. The one person responsible for corralling stakeholders,
collating all the necessary information and getting a decision made by
the agreed date. 

A = Approver. The one person who makes a tie-breaking decision should
the team be unable to  reach consensus 

C = Contributors. They have knowledge or expertise that may influence
the decision -- i.e., they have a voice, but no vote.

I = Informed. They are informed of the final decision.
