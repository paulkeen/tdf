## Epics for Lean Canvas Estimation

Product Manager need to build Lean Canvas's as part of the Stack Ranking
process. Effort is a core element of the RICE scoring, with Technology
often being the largest cost.

Epics should be broken into a series of Epics with the Effort measured
in T-shirt sizes. Epic estimation should be a group activity with the
following people

-   Product Manager/Owner

-   Delivery Lead

-   Tech Lead

-   Solutions Architect

Once the effort is provided, costs can be calculated based on squad size
and velocity.
