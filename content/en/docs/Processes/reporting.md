## Project RAG Status

RAG status tracking are for Projects only. Accounting for delivery,
budget, scope and resource elements.

-   Pre delivery RAG status to remain "Grey" until project has been
    initiated

-   Project RAG status will be a combination of 4 elements: delivery,
    budget, scope and resources

-   For a project to remain on overall Green a maximum of one amber is
    allowed (no reds)

-   For a project to remain on overall Amber a maximum of one red is
    allowed

-   For a project to remain on overall Red one or more elements are on
    red

Project to report on a monthly basis the progress against their set
baselines of delivery timeline, budget, scope and resources

Any project on Red will need to provide an action plan to bring project
back on Green

If a project requires re-baselining due to scope change,
reprioritisation, or other unforeseen event (that is approved via
relevant steer co) then RAG can be moved back onto Green (to avoid a
project tracking on Red an entire year when a delay or change is known
early on). PAG will keep track of both initial deadlines and scope as
well as rebase-lined dates.

| **Green** (commitment to delivery) | Project delivery tracking within 4 weeks of initial timeline                                                               | Less than 5% negative deviation to original  | Project has sufficient resources and skills to deliver to original plan | Initial deliverables are still in planned delivery of the project |
| **Amber**                          | Project delivery delayed between 4-8 weeks of initial timeline                                                             | 5-10% negative deviation to original         | Team can foresee risks in maintaining right resource levels             | Scope has a risk of being reduced due to issues in project        |
| **Red**                            | Project delivery delayed more than 8 weeks or if a project is carrying a regulatory deadline and is delayed beyond 4 weeks | More than 10% negative deviation to original | Work is delayed or scope is jeopardised due to resource / skill issues  | Scope needing a change in order to meet delivery timelines        |
