### Estimation

All activity is based upon the unit of measure of a story point. Story
points are a unit of measure for expressing an estimate of the overall
effort that will be required to fully implement a backlogÂ item or any
other piece of work.

Estimations are provided for all User Stories and Spikes prior to the
commencement of the work. Bugs are retrospectivity given a Story Point
due to the high variability nature of a bug with limited ability to
plan.

A Story Point effort does not change whether the work is completed by a
single of programming pair. Points should be estimated using the
fibonacci sequence (0.5, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13)

How teams derive estimates is left to the team themselves but should be
considered to be a group activity.
