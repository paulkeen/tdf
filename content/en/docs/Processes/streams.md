The Technology structure is based around [Team
Topologies](https://teamtopologies.com/). Conscious of interactions with
Conway's Law and the cognitive load of trying to know the whole banking
domains, we align ourselves into Streams of work.

Stream-aligned teams focus on a single, impactful stream of work. It can
be a single product or service, a single set of features, a single user
journey, or a single user persona. The team is empowered to build and
deliver customer or user value as quickly, safely, and independently as
possible, without requiring hand-offs to other teams to perform parts of
the work.

### Streams vs Projects

A Stream is defined as an end-to-end business process and the associated
steps Tyro takes to deliver customer value.

Whilst we do Projects, many of them, we try to keep Projects within the
boundary of a Stream. Long term value streams differ from traditional
project models of forming, storming, norming and performing in several
ways:

-   They are comprised of long-lived, cross-functional teams and teams
    of teams instead of temporary groups organized around a specific
    project.

-   Because the teams operate on an ongoing basis, we are able to build
    specialities and efficiencies through continuous improvement.
    Temporary teams, on the other hand, are always starting from
    scratch, with little opportunity to improve performance and
    efficiency.

-   Tyro runs a "You build it, you support it" approach. With persistent
    Streams the team remains long after projects and capabilities have
    been delivered. The Mean Time To Recovery (MTTR) is greatly reduced.

Because Stream teams work on the full spectrum of delivery, they are, by
necessity, closer to the customer. This team incorporates customer
feedback in development cycles, while maintaining software in
production.

### Stream Delivery

Stream delivery is a backlog of work broken down by four categories:
feature, technical, compliance and support.

Key milestones with committed dates are scoped and estimated. Burn down
charts against features and project are reported
