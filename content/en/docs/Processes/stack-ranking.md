Stack ranking forces the business to make a discussion and decision on
what is more important than others. Every company has similar
challenges; resources are scarce, moving faster is a competitive
advantage, defining value is a challenge.

Most projects are a high priority, stack ranking helps select the next
set of initiatives against the backdrop of limited resources...without
simply saying "but we need to do all of them".

We use the revenue forecasts and RICE scoring model to help
decision-making. Notable exceptions that usually trump RICE scores are
compliance and risk initiatives. Tyro is a bank after all.

### RICE Scoring

RICE is an acronym for the four factors we use to evaluate each project
idea: reach, impact, confidence and effort. We use RICE to have a
systematic, rigorous ways to encourage better-informed judgements,
remove personal biases and help defend decision-making.

-   **Reach** is measured in number of people/events per time-period
-   **Impact** is difficult to measure precisely. Choose from a
    multiple-choice scale: 3 for "massive impact", 2 for "high", 1 for
    "medium", 0.5 for "low", and finally 0.25 for "minimal
-   **Confidence** is a percentage, use another multiple-choice scale to
    help avoid decision paralysis. 100% is "high confidence", 80% is
    "medium", 50% is "low"
-   **Effort** is estimated as a number of "person-months" -- the work that
    one team member can do in a month.
