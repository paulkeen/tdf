Although the audience of the TDF is intended for internal use, we
decided to share publicly how we build our Technology at Tyro as a
useful resource for others.

The Tyro Delivery Framework (TDF) brings the right people together to
collaboratively achieve key outcomes that prioritise and deliver value
to customers.

The Tyro Delivery Framework sits alongside the Product Lifecycle
Management (PMLP) which covers the phases before and after the TDF,
largely the handshake is between the Epic and code release.

The TDF is an a la carte menu of activities & practices which support
the delivery of an Epic. Not all activities have to be performed for
each Epic to be delivered - different challenges will require a
different focus. The activities are a driver for a collaborative,
engaging conversation to make Delivery as valuable as possible and set
the team up for a successful outcome.
