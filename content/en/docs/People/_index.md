## Onboarding

Effective onboarding allows our valuable new talent to embed themselves
in our business quickly and sets them up for success. Complete the
following checklist for all new starters:

> 1.  Do new starters have access to all necessary systems and accounts
    before they start?
> 2.  Have they been invited to all the appropriate meetings, added to
    relevant slack groups?
> 3.  Has the new starter been celebrated, introduced to the team, and
    been taken on a tour of the office?
> 4.  Has the new starter been assigned a buddy over the first month?
> 5.  Does your company have a specific list of goals to accomplish for
    the onboarding?
> 6.  Can the new starter write production code in the first week?
> 7.  Does the new starter understand your team\'s core focus and how that
    its within the bigger picture at Tyro?
> 8.  Has the Manager set regular check-in with the new starter?
> 9.  Are Developers instructed in hidden/institutional knowledge early
    on?
> 10. Do new starters feel more excited about the business and their role
    by the end of the day?

## Offboarding

We hate to see people leave, doing it well leaves a lasting impression.

-   Exit interviews: an exit interview should be given to all team
    members. This is the opportunity for the person leaving to provide
    feedback. We encourage one-way advice.
-   Handovers: ensure knowledge, access and contacts are handed over
-   Access removal: remove access to all systems, especially those not
    covered under SSO.
-   Equipment: All equipment should arrive back in a reasonable
    condition

## Career Ladders

## Competency Framework

## Learning

Engineering is a continuous learning pursuit. A core skill for everyone
at Tyro. All Engineers have a learning path documented and tracked to
ensure that we uplift our capabilities both individually and
collectively.

Whilst learning comes in many forms we focus around three core areas:
technical, mentoring and leadership.

**Technical T-shaped Learning**

Technical T-shaped learning is a metaphor for asking our team to be a
good generalist (the horizontal) in a range of disciplines from general
computer science, fundamentals on pros and cons or various languages and
frameworks along with keeping up with different ecosystems of tools and
techniques. The vertical is to specialise in a few key areas, to be the
subject matter expert such as Kubernetes or Kotlin.

To help with general learning, all Engineers have access to O'Reilly
giving a huge library of books, videos and white papers on just about
any technical aspect they should need.

For specialisation we encourage certification around skillsets. This is
both good for Tyro and also, good for the individual. Certifications are
predicated by classroom (physical or virtual) style courses. Engineers
will be given at least one classroom style course per year.

**Technical vs Leadership Mastery**

As your career starts to grow, one needs to make the conscious decision
of whether to move along the technical mastery or leadership mastery
path. At Tyro which path you choose does not limit your career,
seniority or pay.

For those looking to move towards the leadership mastery path, the
Delivery Lead role is a good place to learn and grow leadership skills.
The Delivery Lead role can be, in practice, varied - some people may be
extremely technical while others may have strength in organising
teamwork, technical stories, mentorship heading towards people
management.
